    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this dataset, I used the tweet archive data obtained from the Twitter user @dog_rates,from 2015-2017. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by gathering three datasets from three different sources as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The WeRateDogs Twitter archive\n",
    "This data comes from a csv files that contains basic information, including user id, timestamp and retweet information that is downloaded from the project website. I used pd.read_csv to extract this data.\n",
    "##### The image prediction tsv file\n",
    "This data comes from a tsv files that predicts the dogs breed using a neural network. This tsv file was extracted using url from the Udacity server using request.gets(url)\n",
    "##### Access data from tweeter API\n",
    "For this data, I accessed and stored each tweet's retweet count and favorite information to tweet_json. To access the information, I setup tweepy to authenticate with Twitter credentials using tweepy.OAuthHandler and created the api to connect to twitter with my account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing data\n",
    "By visualizing the datasets in general and sampling some data in depth, I checked the quality and tidiness of the datasets.\n",
    "Quality issues: completeness, validity, accuracy, consistency \n",
    " 1. Change all id to str object\n",
    " 2. Get rid of columns that won't be used for analysis\n",
    " 3. Change all time column to datetime object\n",
    " 4. Since some tweets did not have images ( and has NaN values for expanded_urls ), should remove those data.\n",
    " 5. There are some numbers that doesn't make senses (out of range) for the denominators and numerators. \n",
    " 6. There are decimal numbers in the rating, which are wrongly interpreted and need to be changed manually\n",
    " 7. There are duplicated images in the image prediction (and there are images that are not dogs)\n",
    " 8. There are repetitive columns (such as id and id_str, in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_status_id_str )\n",
    " \n",
    "Tidiness issues:\n",
    " 1. For twitter archive: the 4 stage columns (dogger, floofer, pupper and puppo) can be reduced to one columns \n",
    " 2. There are columns that shows none, instead of NaN. Should be make consistent.\n",
    " 3. For image prediction, combine the confidence columns.\n",
    " 4. Should merge all three datasets by tweet id.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning data\n",
    "Looking through the issues that were identified, I rearrange the issue by the time required to solve. For example, I first changed the datatype of tweet id so I can merge the three datasets. After merging the three datasets, I can avoid some repetitive work, such as gettting rid of unwanted columns and removing replicates. Then I combined columns with same type of information and also added in some data for later analysis.\n",
    "I also make a different copy for some step so that I can easily retrieve some data if any mistakes were made in a intermediate step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclustion, during this process, I learnt several tools for data wrangling. Also, I familarize myself with many sources of help, such as Udacity, stackoverflow and github. \n",
